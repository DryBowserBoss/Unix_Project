This project was created to take multiple input files (mainly .txts)
and output the number of times every word shows up from most common to
least common and creating a "result.txt" to show the result.

This project can be run in the following format
$Project3-2.py tester.txt (tester2.txt) (...)

tester.txt and tester2.txt will be included if you want to use them for
testing, but you can create any .txts you want and use those as well,
the program was built for an unlimited number of inputs.
